parole

Per our conversation, Iâ€™ve briefly outlined the parole process. Each time a parole hearing is held, a Parole Commission Action Form (DOC-1208) is completed by a commissioner . The chair of the Parole Commission must approve or deny recommendations for parole or deferrals greater than 12 months. If the chair of the Parole Commission determines that an inmate should receive a parole grant, a parole order is completed (DOC-1201).


21 different parole entries in the final_action column

Obtained the list of different final_action descriptions. Manually categorized them into parole grant/not grant. Not sure want release means. It's easy to go back in and add or take away a term for a list. Please take a look and see if that's needed.

Johnson, Christopher has multiple entries
Parole grant/grant parole in 2012 and 2016 

CSV files:
parole_grant_list_1208.csv
List of 1208's with parole grant. I used the above terms to select what grant terms are

1208_with_1201.csv
Merged file that shows which 1208's have 1201's. About 1,000 in the 1201, 750ish have 1208's. Fields marked null mean there was not a corresponding 1208 form for that person on the 1201 list. 


It looks like they copy-pasted a filtered version of the1208 outcomes into a new sheet and labeled it 12. The records are identical. It makes it look like everyone that received a parole grant got it approved. 

It makes it look like everyone that received a parole grant got it approved and they sprinkled in some nongrants to make it look like the person that does 1201's is following the board's lead.

grab the 1201 for a couple of random people and look to see that the actual date matches

Also, I feel like the final action for 1201 would be different than the 1208, where the 1201 would have slihtly different language. 

In five year 785 had parole recommended, 1201 indicates they all got it. the rest are non-parole stuff

Ask for a list of defintions for their outcome columns, if they have a legend, key or handbook

Also, who are these people? Race? gender? home town?
